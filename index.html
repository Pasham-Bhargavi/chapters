        <p id="p1">Atom, the basic building block of all matter and chemistry. Atoms can combine with other atoms to form molecules but cannot be divided into smaller parts by ordinary chemical processes.Explore an atom's interior to discover the layout of its nucleus, protons, and electrons Explore an atom's interior to discover the layout of its nucleus, protons, and electronsSee all videos for this article Most of the atom is empty space. The rest consists of three basic types of subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The protons and neutrons form the atom’s central nucleus. (The ordinary hydrogen atom is an exception; it contains one proton but no neutrons.) As their names suggest, protons have a positive electrical charge, while neutrons are electrically neutral—they carry no charge; overall, then, the nucleus has a positive charge. Circling the nucleus is a cloud of electrons, which are negatively charged. Like opposite ends of a magnet that attract one another, the negative electrons are attracted to a positive force, which binds them to the nucleus. The nucleus is small and dense compared with the electrons, which are the lightest charged particles in nature. The electrons circle the nucleus in orbital paths called shells, each of which holds only a certain number of electrons.</p>
        
        <h2 id="chapter2">Chapter2</h2>
        <p id="p2">More than 90 types of atoms exist in nature, and each kind of atom forms a different chemical element. Chemical elements are made up of only one type of atom—gold contains only gold atoms, and neon contains only neon atoms--and they are ranked in order of their atomic number (the total number of protons in its nucleus) in a chart called the periodic table. Accordingly, because an atom of iron has 26 protons in its nucleus, its atomic number is 26 and its ranking on the periodic table of chemical elements is 26. Because an ordinary atom has the same number of electrons as protons, an element’s atomic number also tells how many electrons its atoms have, and it is the number and arrangement of the electrons in their orbiting shells that determines how one atom interacts with another. The key shell is the outermost one, called the valence shell. If this outermost shell is complete, or filled with the maximum number of electrons for that shell, the atom is stable, with little or no tendency to interact with other atoms. But atoms with incomplete outer shells seek to fill or to empty such shells by gaining or losing electrons or by sharing electrons with other atoms. This is the basis of an atom’s chemical activity. Atoms that have the same number of electrons in the outer shell have similar chemical properties.</p>

        <p id="p3">All atoms are roughly the same size, whether they have 3 or 90 electrons. Approximately 50 million atoms of solid matter lined up in a row would measure 1 cm (0.4 inch). A convenient unit of length for measuring atomic sizes is the angstrom (Å), defined as 10−10 metre. The radius of an atom measures 1–2 Å. Compared with the overall size of the atom, the nucleus is even more minute. It is in the same proportion to the atom as a marble is to a football field. In volume the nucleus takes up only 10−14 metres of the space in the atom—i.e., 1 part in 100,000. A convenient unit of length for measuring nuclear sizes is the femtometre (fm), which equals 10−15 metre. The diameter of a nucleus depends on the number of particles it contains and ranges from about 4 fm for a light nucleus such as carbon to 15 fm for a heavy nucleus such as lead. In spite of the small size of the nucleus, virtually all the mass of the atom is concentrated there. The protons are massive, positively charged particles, whereas the neutrons have no charge and are slightly more massive than the protons. The fact that nuclei can have anywhere from 1 to nearly 300 protons and neutrons accounts for their wide variation in mass. The lightest nucleus, that of hydrogen, is 1,836 times more massive than an electron, while heavy nuclei are nearly 500,000 times more massive.</p>
        
        <h2 id="chapter4">Chapter4</h2>
        <p id="p4">The number of neutrons in a nucleus affects the mass of the atom but not its chemical properties. Thus, a nucleus with six protons and six neutrons will have the same chemical properties as a nucleus with six protons and eight neutrons, although the two masses will be different. Nuclei with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are said to be isotopes of each other. All chemical elements have many isotopes.It is usual to characterize different isotopes by giving the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus—a quantity called the atomic mass number. In the above example, the first atom would be called carbon-12 or 12C (because it has six protons and six neutrons), while the second would be carbon-14 or 14C.</p>
        
        <h2 id="chapter5">Chapter5</h2>
        <p id="p5">Scientists have known since the late 19th century that the electron has a negative electric charge. The value of this charge was first measured by the American physicist Robert Millikan between 1909 and 1910. In Millikan’s oil-drop experiment, he suspended tiny oil drops in a chamber containing an oil mist. By measuring the rate of fall of the oil drops, he was able to determine their weight. Oil drops that had an electric charge (acquired, for example, by friction when moving through the air) could then be slowed down or stopped by applying an electric force. By comparing applied electric force with changes in motion, Millikan was able to determine the electric charge on each drop. After he had measured many drops, he found that the charges on all of them were simple multiples of a single number. This basic unit of charge was the charge on the electron, and the different charges on the oil drops corresponded to those having 2, 3, 4,… extra electrons on them. The charge on the electron is now accepted to be 1.602176565 × 10−19 coulomb. For this work Millikan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1923.</p>
